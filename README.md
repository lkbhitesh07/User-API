# User-API
In this project I have implemented django rest framework to get some data via API's. I have implemented functionality of GET, PUT, POST, DELETE and to POST multiple JSON data at once.

# How to setup

## Step - 1
You have to fork this repo and clone it, for this
You can see the `fork` option on the top right corner, after that you'll see an option to `clone` this repo, you have to copy the URL and go to the local folder you want this project to get saved and open it in terminal then run `git clone "URL you copied"`

## Step - 2
It's advised to create a virtual environment so that the project dependencies dosent get installed in the main system, So for this run 
- `pip install virtualenv`
- `virtualenv env_name`
- `pip install requirements.txt`
This will install all the dependencies.

## Step - 3
Run
`python manage.py runserver`

All set and you are ready to go.
